  <h3 id="kha-shmup-tutorial-part-0">Kha Shmup Tutorial Part 0</h3>

<p><a href="http://kha.ktxsoftware.com">Kha</a> describes itself as a “super-portable dev
kit.” The tool is kind of equivalent to the <a href="http://haxe.org/">Haxe</a>
version of <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a>. Essentially its a tool by
which you can use Haxe to make games or other media applications, and
it allows you to target Linux, OSX, Windows, Android, iOS, HTML5, and
several other targets very efficiently.</p>

<p>Kha has always seemed super interesting to me - I love Haxe, and I am
always on the lookout for open source game frameworks that have a high
degree of portability. I love and continue to use
<a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3d</a>, but I feel it has a few downsides when
it comes to 2d development, and often I feel its closed-source nature
fights against it. Recently I was trying to learn the low-level
Transport Layer Networking in Unity, and there were often questions I
had that would have been easily grokkable had I access to the source.</p>

<p>Kha seems like a great tool, but I have had many complaints about it,
which I have seen shared among a few other developers who have tried
getting into it - it uses an unfamiliar build system, its api is
somewhat of a moving target, and worst of all - it lacks
documentation.</p>

<p>That last part is often a curse that kill many open source projects -
no matter how good your software may be, if people can’t figure out
how to use it, it won’t get used. When people are looking for a
library or framework to use they aren’t often willing to read a
majority of the code base, post on forums, jump into irc channels and
the like.</p>

<p>The lack of documentation is one that is pretty easily solved - people
who have actually penetrated and started undestanding the software
just have to write down, talk about, or cast themselves discussing it.</p>

<p>I decided rather than look at Kha and say “Eh, not enough docs for
me..” that I should try to understand as much of it as I can and write
down what will hopefully be helpful to others. The Kha community has
been very welcoming and helpful to me, someone who basically just pops
up once and a while and asks “how do I…”</p>

<p>So my process of documenting will be the creation of a very small
shoot ‘em up game, or “shmup.” I will be going step-by-step on github,
so hopefully as I explain each step you will be able to see the code
and how one might grow a small Kha program.</p>

<p>I will be assuming that you know Haxe. If you do not
<a href="http://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/">the documentation</a> is
alright to get started. For reference I am using 3.2.1 on OSX, but
this should work on Linux or Windows.</p>

<p>To run my examples you will need a copy of NodeJS, which you can
download <a href="http://nodejs.org/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Kha is often included as a submodule within an individual Kha project,
which is how I have it set up in this tutorial. You can use Kha from
haxelib, but the version I am targeting has not been released to
haxelib yet. I will update these tutorials when it has.</p>

<p>Once you have Haxe ready to go and a recent version of NodeJS, we will
be ready to begin putting our game together.</p>
