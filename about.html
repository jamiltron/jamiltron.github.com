<h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Justin Hamilton. I am currently a graduate student at the <a href="http://www.cs.unomaha.edu/">University of Nebraska at Omaha.</a>
I hold of B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from there. I am also a full-time programmer for Prairie Ventures.</p>
<p>My current projects include a <a href="https://github.com/jamiltron/forsight">Forth interpreter written in Scheme</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/jamiltron/4clojure-solutions">working through</a> the problems listed at <a href="http://4clojure.com">4clojure</a>. I also want
to become better at functional programming (and Clojure in general) as well as try my hand at a web app or two.</p>
<p>I live with my wonderful girlfriend in Omaha, NE, and in my free time I enjoy practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, reading, and playing games.</p>
