<h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Justin Hamilton. I am currently a graduate student at the <a href="http://www.cs.unomaha.edu/">University of Nebraska at Omaha.</a>
I hold of B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from there. I am also a full-time software engineer for a great Venture company, doing
a lot of really awesome web and mobile development.</p>
<p>I am really interested in functional programming, having fell in love with Scheme when I discovered 
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a>, and later moved on to programming more and more in Clojure and
Haskell, although I still have a lot of love for languages like Python, Ruby, and Lua.</p>
<p>I live with my wonderful girlfriend in Omaha, NE, and in my free time I enjoy practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, reading, and playing games.</p>
