title: Moving My Blog to Github

# {{page.title}}

Hello there, I thought I would try out moving my blog to github, and test out
this whole Jekyll thing. I would like to make my blog posts a little more
regular, and I hope I can hit maybe around a post every two weeks or so. I will
be mostly talking about school and computer science on here. I will keep personal
stuff to twitter and facebook. Anyway, I hope you enjoy!
