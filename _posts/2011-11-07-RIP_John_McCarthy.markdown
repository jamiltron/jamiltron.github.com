The past few weeks have been very sad. A lot has been said about McCarthy, he is one of the giants of our field. 
I am a Lisp fanatic, and honestly without having discovered Scheme and SICP years ago I would not be as interested in 
Computer Science as much as I am today without the foundation that McCarthy made. You will be truely missed, and thank 
you for all your work.

Thank you.
