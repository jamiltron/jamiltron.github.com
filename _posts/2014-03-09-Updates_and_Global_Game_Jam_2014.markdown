### Long Time, No Updates ###

So it's been a long time since I have updated this and a lot has happened - I moved from Omaha, NE to San Francisco, CA, got a new job, and lots of other things. I thought about giving a short update by posting something I did a few months ago - [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/).

### Global Game Jam ###

Game development has always been a huge hobby of mine, and having moved to San Francisco I was fortunate enough to be able to participate in a huge game jam. I got on an amazing team with a very talented game developer, an awesome computer science student who also had great pixel art skills, and a great artist. The game we came up with is kind of a Gone Home-inspired 2d game written in Unity, you can check it out [here](http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/bread-crumbs).
