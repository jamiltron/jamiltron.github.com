<h2 class="post_title">RIP Dennis Ritchie</h2>

I never met you, but you were truely a giant upon whose shoulders stand generations of scientists, programmers, 
designers, technologists, and many more. It is amazing just how great your contributions were, that C and Unix to 
date have such an impact on the industry. I am thankful for having been able to develop things based on your works, 
and without K&R 2e I don't know if I would still be a programmer today. You will be missed.

Thank you.
